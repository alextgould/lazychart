# To Do

## High priority

* 

## Medium priority

delay charts
 - where there are multiple records per key over time, need an additional parameter for key column(s), so you can summarise to have one record per key per time period (e.g. one user per quarter)
* Ability to combine charts on the same axes? i.e. take an existing chart and layer another one on top? Is this standard matplotlib functionality? Can I do this using a return_data=True style fig, ax and then pass ax to the next chart?
* Layered group_by i.e. group_by=[‘col1, ‘col2’] does permutations of col1 x col2?
* figure level subtitles for compare() charts rather than having it pass down to each individual chart
* take the logic that checks for passed y value being in the df and move this up the chain to the normalize_kwargs or similar
e.g. see raise ValueError(f"y={y_col!r} not found in data.")
* when taking the defensive copy of df, only copy the relevant columns, so if someone passes a huge df we don't copy the whole thing but just take the 3 relevant columns into our copy

* look at the different standard plot "kind" options and add them to this list
 - 'barh', 'hist', 'box', 'kde', 'density', 'area', 'scatter', 'hexbin'
* update README, including markdown formatted tables of functions/arguments
* trend lines on line/scatter charts (linear? extrapolate?)

## Low priority

* If we use x_max to limit the x axis and as a result only have say 2 ticks, can we force it to get more? Should we manually set up the ticks? Or let the user customise this (e.g. “show_all_x_ticks” or something)
* Allow target_x = [6, 12] to add multiple grids
* Add x_target y_target as alias for target_x target_y or vice versa

* review original "impossible" prompt to see what features we haven't implemented yet
* consider if ChartParams should / shouldn't be responsible for coercing values e.g. currently making x_min/x_max datetime-friendly within the place where we set_xlim
* split code into separate modules (as late as possible pre v1.0.0)

Prompt (slow, split up?)

I've attached the latest copy of my lazychart code base in core.py. Help me with this:

2. When using delay charts:
a. where there are multiple records per key over time, need an additional parameter for key column(s), so you can summarise to have one record per key per time period (e.g. one user per quarter). Aggfunc would be required and would apply where there are multiple records with the same key column(s).

# Next charts

```prompt
I'm thinking about what charts I should add into my lazychart framework next. I note with matplotlib they have 'kind' values which include 'line' 'bar' 'pie', but also include the following: 'barh', 'hist', 'box', 'kde', 'density', 'area', 'scatter', 'hexbin'

1. Give me a priority rank /10 for each of the above charts, listing them in descending order from highest priority to lowest priority and giving a small explanation of why this priority rating was given.

2. What other charts would you consider "high priority". This could include "basic" charts, but my guess it that most of the "basic" charts are covered above. So also consider charts that would be particularly useful to me as a data scientist, such as for EDA, or for building and assessing machine learning models. For instance, correlation matrices, partial dependence plots (PDPs), training curves, violin plots and so forth are all of interest to me. I may need to consider how much I leverage existing frameworks versus creating things myself from scratch. I'm keen to get a wide and varied list of options, and please give each of these a priority rank /10 similar to the previous question, so I can start thinking about what order to implement them in.

3. As a specific example, I want to create PDPs with mix charts, so accepting a sklearn model and having it plot a PDP is less useful than getting the raw chart data and using this to create a plot. I ultimately want the lazychart interface to continue to be super accessible and easy, so for example, it might be good to accept actuals and predicteds, but it might also be good to accept a model object and compatible dataset and have the function create the raw data from these objects. I don't want to overcomplicate my code with all permutations, but also don't want to assume the user will do a bunch of extra work to use what is meant to be a "lazy" package. Give some thoughts on this example as a case study of the more general question of what inputs I should be looking to use with my machine learning related charts.

4. As a final thought exercise, note that the lazychart package is somewhat unique in that it can do not only charting but also data wrangling. For example, we're working on the "delay" chart, where we look at incremental/cumulative distributions bsaed on input dates and/or date columns. I imagine there are similar exercises that we could incorporate, that would allow a data scientist to "cut to the chase" and produce a really useful visualisation without having to transform the data as we can code the data transformation into the charting package. Give me a bunch of examples of this sort of data prep / aggregation -> chart that might be worth considering.

```chatGPT
1) Priorities for the next “kinds”

Below is a pragmatic, descending priority list (score /10) for the kinds you listed, based on usefulness for EDA/ML work and ease of adding to your current pipeline (which already has bar, line, pie, the shared _chart_pipeline, tidy aggregation, palettes, legends, mix/compare, etc.). 
 

hist — 10/10
Bread-and-butter distribution view; underpins outlier checks, skew, binning choices, and model feature engineering. Add a numeric binning path (specialized aggregation) then plot as bars/step.

scatter — 10/10
Go-to for relationships, residuals, heteroscedasticity; pairs nicely with mix/compare. First cut = simple x vs y; later add hue=group_by, alpha, jitter.

box — 9/10
Robust distribution-by-group; great for quick group comparisons. Your long→wide helpers and grouping logic make this straightforward to add on top of the tidy aggregator.

hexbin — 8/10
Scales scatter to large n. Very handy for dense EDA on continuous features; a good complement to scatter.

kde / density — 8/10
Smooth distribution view; add for 1D (and possibly 2D later). Start 1D to keep dependencies minimal.

area — 7/10
Composition over time; can reuse line + fill_between logic, or stacked areas via the existing pivot+stacking percent handling.

barh — 7/10
Horizontal bar is a UX win for long category labels; trivial addition if you flip axes on your bar primitive.

(“kde” and “density” are normally synonyms—consider exposing one name with an alias.)

2) Other high-value charts for a data scientist

I grouped these by priority for a healthy EDA/ML workflow. Scores reflect impact vs. effort given your architecture (long-form aggregator, group_by, x_period, compare/mix, and figure-level controls). 
 

High (10–8)

Correlation matrix (heatmap) — 10/10
Must-have EDA. Add a helper that computes corr (Pearson/Spearman) and plots as a heatmap with optional mask/annotation.

ROC & PR curves — 10/10
Model selection basics. Accept either raw y_true/y_score or precomputed curve points. Add micro/macro options for multiclass.

Calibration plot (reliability curve + histogram) — 9/10
Critical for probabilistic models; offer binning options and ECE/Brier displayed in subtitle.

Confusion matrix (heatmap) — 9/10
With rates and counts toggle; normalize by true row by default.

Pair plot / scatter matrix — 9/10
Fast multi-feature overview (sample if big). Start with numeric-only + optional hue.

Violin / boxen / ridgeline (one of) — 8/10
Deeper distribution comparisons than box; start with violin.

ECDF (cumulative distribution) — 8/10
Extremely informative, simple to implement via sorted values; pairs well with “delay” style CDF you already have. 

Learning curves (train/val vs. iterations) — 8/10
For over/underfit diagnosis; accept raw arrays or a tidy df.

Medium (7–6)

PDP & ICE — 8/10
See section (3) on inputs; expose both charting and data-only APIs.

Feature importance — 7/10
Agnostic bar chart from provided importances or callable; add permutation importance helper later.

Gain/Lift & KS curves — 7/10
Very common in scoring workflows; can compute from y_true/y_score.

Residual plots (actual vs. predicted, residual vs. fitted, QQ) — 7/10
Quick regression diagnostics; low effort once scatter/hist are in.

Target distribution by category (lollipop/ordered bar) — 7/10
Turns noisy bar charts into readable ranked comparisons.

Nice-to-have (5–4)

Missingness matrix/heatmap — 6/10
Visualize isna() patterns quickly.

Bump chart (rank over time) — 6/10
Useful for ranking dynamics; leverages your x_period.

Two-way pivot heatmap (e.g., feature vs. feature) — 6/10
Great for interaction scouting; simple groupby/pivot + imshow.

3) PDPs as a case study: what inputs should ML charts accept?

You already have a clean pattern: heavy lifting upstream, tidy table downstream, then a primitive that draws and returns (fig, ax, chart_data); plus return_values=True to grab the data. Lean into that. 

Recommend a dual-mode API:

A) Data-first (lightweight, composable)

cm.pdp(
  data=pdp_df,           # tidy: columns=['feature','grid','pdp'] (+ optional 'ice_id')
  x='grid', y='pdp',
  group_by='feature',    # or 'ice_id' to overlay ICE
  return_values=True
)


Users who already computed PDP/ICE can just plot.

Works perfectly with mix() and compare() out of the box. 

B) Model-aware (convenience, still returns raw data)

cm.pdp(
  model=estimator, X=df_or_array, features=['age','income'],
  kind='average',              # 'average' | 'ice' | 'both'
  grid='quantile',             # 'quantile' | 'linspace' | explicit array
  ice_samples=1000,            # subsample rows for ICE for speed
  predict_fn=None,             # optional override; default=prob or predict
  target_class=None,           # for classification; supports int/label
  return_values=True
)


Behavior

If data is provided → do not touch the model; just draw.

Else if model and X are provided → compute a tidy pdp_df and then call the same internal draw routine. Always return the computed pdp_df in chart_data to keep the “lazy” ethos.

Predict function resolution:

If classifier with predict_proba and target_class set → use that column.

Else fall back to predict.

Allow predict_fn override for exotic models (XGBoost, LightGBM, pipelines).

Interoperability: because PDP ultimately yields a tidy table, users can feed it right back into mix() (e.g., PDP main + segment mix panel by region), or into compare() (multiple features). 

Keep permutations in check

Two entry paths only (A or B).

A small set of grid options; sensible defaults.

Optional ICE overlays via kind='both' with percentile bands (e.g., 10–90th) rather than every line.

The rest—titles, legends, palettes—already handled centrally by your figure stylers. 

4) “Prep → Chart” shortcuts worth baking in

These mirror your delay chart idea (do the transformation for the user, then visualize). They save tons of analyst time. 
 

Cohort retention heatmap
Prep: derive cohort by first-seen month; compute retention by age (0..N months).
Chart: month-age heatmap with annotations.

Funnel conversion (with drop-off deltas)
Prep: count users at each step per segment/date; compute step and cumulative conversion.
Chart: horizontal step bars + line for cumulative; or waterfall style.

Pareto (80/20) analysis
Prep: rank categories by contribution; compute cumulative share.
Chart: bar + line (cumulative %) on secondary axis.

Rolling trend with smoothing
Prep: compute 7-day/28-day rolling mean and CI.
Chart: daily line + shaded rolling band; your x_period and show_gaps already help. 

Anomaly (SPC/control) chart
Prep: mean + 3σ limits (optionally robust MAD).
Chart: line with horizontal target/limits (you already support target lines). 

AB test uplift with CIs
Prep: compute metric per variant, standard errors / CIs.
Chart: point+error bars; optional uplift waterfall.

Calibration (probability reliability)
Prep: bin predictions, compute observed vs. expected + ECE.
Chart: line y=x reference + points/bars per bin.

Gain/Lift & KS
Prep: sort by score, compute cumulative positives, lift, and max KS.
Chart: lift curve, gains chart, KS vertical marker.

Calendar heatmap
Prep: aggregate daily metric; pivot by weekday vs week number.
Chart: year calendar heatmap (or monthly facet).

Lorenz / Gini
Prep: cumulative share of outcome vs population.
Chart: Lorenz curve with shaded Gini area.

Ridgeline (joy) distributions
Prep: per-group density over the same x.
Chart: stacked filled KDEs (or layered violins).

Bump chart (rank over time)
Prep: compute rank per time period.
Chart: multi-line with width or labels at ends.

Two-sample ECDF compare
Prep: ECDFs for group A vs B.
Chart: dual ECDFs + D-stat marker (KS).

Confusion matrix + per-class metrics
Prep: confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1 per class.
Chart: heatmap + side bar of per-class metrics.

Implementation notes (quick wins)

Reuse _chart_pipeline for: hist (with an internal binning step), scatter, box, violin, area, barh, hexbin. Your tidy aggregator + _pivot_data already sets you up for grouped variants and stacking/percent. 

Use mix() to add automatic contextual side panels (e.g., PDP + segment counts, scatter + group distribution). It already synthesizes a second chart and calls compare. 

Return raw chart data consistently (you already support return_values=True). This is perfect for the “data-then-chart” pattern requested for PDP/ICE. 

You’ve already got bar/line/pie primitives, legends/titles, axis formatting, and smart time binning/gap filling—great foundations to keep new kinds concise.

# Prompt history

## First "impossible prompt" for GPT-5

I would like to develop a Python script/class/repo/package (exact details to be discussed - it will probably start as one or more classes/scripts in a repo and will eventually become a package, but if there's anything that should be done in the early stages to make the package transition easy it may be worth doing so). My vision is to be able to rapidly generate data visualisations using Python. My aim is to make this process as clean and simple for the user as possible. For example:
* I want to have sensible defaults and/or arguments to easily control things like x/y axis limits, x/y axis labels, title, subtitle, legends, presence/absence of gridlines etc. I often find myself having to look up and add many lines of code to control these things and would prefer to just pass arguments when needed
* A key feature that I think will differentiate my package/class from other packages is that it will have the capacity (and likely default behaviour) to remember things such as x/y axis titles/formats, source datasets etc, so when you want to produce several similar images (e.g. a series of images that use different variables or different categories from a categorical variable), you don't have to keep calling all the parameters and can just call the one that is changing each time. For this reason I'm contemplating calling the class/package something like "sticky" so you might have e.g. from sticky import bar and then after calling bar(data=..., y_min=0) then next call to bar() would remember the data being used as e.g. self.data self.y_min (unless an argument such as sticky = False is passed) and apply these to subsequent charts (unless an argument such as use_sticky = False is passed)

I want to be able to generate most of the standard sorts of plots that someone using Excel for example would be able to generate - for example:
* line charts, with different lines (in Excel this would be "series") for each value of a categorical variable
* bar charts (vertical and horizontal, values and proportions (in Excel this would "100% stacked chart")), with stacking/clustering by a categorical variable (or 2 with multiple levels)
  * make it easy to create histograms as a special class of bar chart, with count of rows or % rows
* scatter/bubble chart (x/y with optional additional variables for color/size of points)
* pie chart (ideally just need to specify the category variable and then % rows is done automatically, with % value done if another numeric variable is specified)

Some additional features that are optional but could be valuable:
* ability to add trend lines (line and scatter/bar charts) - at a minimum, a linear one, but potentially some more fits, noting that I want to balance the complexity of the code base with the potential usefulness of the features being added added and prefer simple but flexible code; also being able to "forecast" by extending the trendline beyond the range of the data
* ability to add one or more horizontal/vertical dotted lines at specific values (e.g. a target x value or a y value that indicates a change in environment) (at a minimum, to line/scatter charts, but ideally also between bars in a categorical chart if e.g. monthly bars were being shown)
* where categories are used (e.g. line charts with multiple series, or bar charts with categorical x/y values), sorting data in intelligent ways by default and making it easy to change between common sorting schemes (e.g. sorting by descending value vs alphabetical x axis variable for categories)
* formatting axes values in intelligent ways by default and making it easy to change between common formats (e.g. % (e.g. values are 0.45), % but with automatic /100 (e.g. values are 45 but relate to percentages), comma delimited (e.g. values are 5000 so format as 5,000), shorter values (e.g. values are 5000000 but show as 5M or for 5000 show as 5k)), also ability to easily adjust the number of decimal places
* ability to show/hide legend and some intelligent code to place it on the right/bottom with the figure size being sensible and not having to manually adjust the figsize to get this to happen (this may be complex, but could involve e.g. aspect ratios, or figuring out the default size of the plot without the legend / the legend without the plot, and then adjusting the size to include the legend)
* ability to automatically group smaller categories with less than a given % of the data (e.g. 10% by default) into an "Other" category
* ability to adjust the "font size" of the title, axes labels and legend, possibly having some better defaults or intelliegent way to adjust this dynamically in response to what's being plotted
* ability to easily "remove" or "turn off" the title/subtitle and x/y axes labels
* scatter plots
  * having an optional parameter to add "jitter" so the density of values in the same/similar location can be more easily seen
  * having the ability to pass a categorical x axis value (may be the default behaviour, I'm not familiar with this)
* ability to more easily control colours or use colour more effectively
  * ability to define a schema using hex values (e.g. brand colours from a marketing department) and have these be incorporated (e.g. creating discrete/continuous colour maps, handling scenarios where more categories exist than the provided hex colours and so more are appended on in an extended set of colours)
  * ability to highlight specific datapoints in some relatively easy manner (e.g. having a highlight_points Bool series that matches the data and adjusts the color based on a highlight_colour parameter)
* ability to add annotations to the data in an easy manner (e.g. passing a tooltips Str series that matches the data)
* ability to pass a function that will intelligently adjust the x/y axis scales (e.g. reverse out a "z score tranformation", apply/remove logarithmic scaling)

I'm interested in hearing/incorporating any other frequently suggested data visualisation aspects (e.g. from users of Tableau, Power BI), so the list above is not exhaustive and if there's any major gaps we should try and address those.

I may also want to incorporate some more unique plots that come up in my work as a Data Scientist - for example:
* combination charts
    * bar chart and a line chart on the same plot using different y axes on the left/right side of the chart
    * possibly having function/functionality to combine a list of related data "series" within the one plot (e.g. having a "historical" series and a "forecast" series, and having these display as categories within a line or bar chart)
* line charts that use a seasonality variable and period to overlay successive periods (e.g. taking a time series that has monthly values across 3 years and showing this as 3 lines with 12 points rather than 1 line with 36 points)
* heat maps, contour plots or surface plots
  * correlation matrix - ideally with a default view that only shows the bottom left triangle and not the top triangle or main diagonal, so the scale is more informative
  * geospatial (e.g. specify lat and long inputs and another variable to show as heat)
* confusion matrix - handling simple 2x2 but also more complex such as 3x3 classes
* partial dependence plots
* distribution charts e.g.
  * box (or box and whiskers) plot (vertical lines showing min/max, boxes showing Q1 to Q3, line showing median)
    * if not already covered, ability to make this into a "candlestick" chart with a time variable on the x axis
  * density plot (shows probability distribution of a continuous variable, potentially with multiple lines for different categories of a categorical variable)
  * dumbbell plot that uses two values for each category instead of one, with two points connected by a line to show min/max values for each category
  * "age/sex pyramid" style chart where two categories are shown on the left/right side of a symmetrical x axis, comparing the distribution of each against a variable on the y axis
  * violin plots (combine features of box plot and kernel density plot)
* gantt charts (where there are categories on the y axis, a time variable on the x axis and a series of horizontal bars for each, potentially having multiple bars on one line separated by empty space)
* "funnel" chart as a special type of horizontal bar chart with the bars being centered
* waterfall chart (pass categorical variable for x axis and min/max values for the y axis with vertical bars being shown between the min/max values)

I'm not sure whether I should build upon raw matplotlib or an existing higher level package such as seaborn. My fear is that building on an existing higher level package will make it harder for me to control things and introduce dependency risk if they change the way they do things, however my fear of using raw matplotlib is that I'll end up reinventing the wheel. I think it's safe to assume data will be generally passed as pandas dataframes. It's also worth noting that I don't want to work towards interactive charts at this stage, and want to focus only on more quickly churning out static visualisations.

Finally, I want to have a good dataset that will allow me to test and demo the functionality of the tool within my repo, for example, in a Jupyter notebook. I have some existing code that generates somewhat interesting data but lacks a time series aspect. For reference, this is shown below and it may be a useful starting point for creating the dataset that will be used for demonstrating charts. I'm open to scrapping this and doing something completely different, although ideally the data will be interesting and not the typical "sales by month by region" data that is used everywhere. The data probably needs to be rich enough with both quantitative (numeric) and qualitative (categorical) columns, a temporaral (time) dimension, and potentially include ordinal (ordered) and nominal (not ordered) categories with a mixture of cardinality (many vs few categorical levels).

Based on the above context, help me create a repo that meets as many of my specifications as possible. I'm not completely familiar with the limitations of GPT-5, but aim to give me a "one shot" output which gets me as close to my vision as possible in the most appropriate way. For example, this might mean producing a report that clearly outlines the folder structure and contents of each of the files. Alternatively, you might produce all of the files and make them available for me to download. I've been using Gemini models recently and they integrate well with Colab. I'm flexible, so long as I get as close as possible to my vision in a single attempt. I think you will need to think deeply about this task in order to do well. Good luck :)

### Observations

* impressive how much it did, but also some pretty obvious mistakes (e.g. __init__.py tried to include a variable that was being created a few lines later within __init__.py), complete lack of comments/docstrings
* failed to identify more elegant way of doing things using decorators which I came to with vscode copilot (GPT 4.1?) shortly afterwards
* scratched the surface on available charts, but this is probably good given I'll need to refactor it all anyway
* didn't really do a good job of improving the synthetic data generation, might need to do this a specific task, and more generally, try to make small iterative changes with human oversight - which is exactly how I would have approached things before listening to Sam Altman talking up GPT-5 - and a bit of a reality check when people talk about it as if it's already able to operate independently

### Sub-prompt: Synthetic data

Here's my existing function for generating synthetic data:

<TODO: paste function here>

Try to improve this so it will be useful in testing advanced plots. For example, this might be a useful starting point:

* Random user attributes

```python
age_band = np.random.choice(
    ["<20", "20–29", "30–39", "40–49", "50+"], p=[0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15]
)
personality = np.random.choice(
    ["Type A", "Type B", "Type C", "Type D", "Type E",
     "Type F", "Type G", "Type H", "Type I", "Type J"],
    p=[0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
)
```

* Trend parameter per user (representing their "life trajectory") – a slope factor from -0.5 to +0.5 that influences their metrics over time (e.g. alcohol use or exercise levels getting better or worse over time).

* Metric generation

```python 
base_value = np.random.normal(50, 10)
time_series = base_value + slope * np.arange(n_days) + np.random.normal(0, 5, n_days)
```

You could then make alcohol use, mood, etc. each follow their own slopes per user.

I think this might give plenty of variability for charts like: grouped bars by age, trend lines, histograms by category, etc.

## Second "impossible prompt" for GPT-5: Major refactor

I have uploaded my latest python file. I want you to *carefully* refactor my code so it retains as much as possible of my original logic and comments, except where it makes sense to remove things entirely. This will be a major refactor which will implement the following structural changes:
- ChartMonkey will be stateful, with self.chart_params being used throughout in place of the current "passing around kwargs" approach
- retain the public facing kwargs interface but convert immediately into a ChartConfig class, in part to ensure sensible centralised defaults
- consolidate the layout logic, including replacing some or all of the decorators with internal helpers within the class
- cleaner class layout (arrange functions with core data logic > styling and layout > chart primitives > public api with comment lines to delineate the sections)

A few snippets of code that may be helpful in making this transition:

```example of ChartConfig class
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Optional, Union, Dict

```conversion of kwargs and sticky parameters into self.chart_params
config = ChartConfig(**{**self._sticky, **kwargs})
self.chart_params = config
```

A few relevant comments from an earlier brainstorming session:

```cleaner class layout
A seasoned dev might structure the class like this:

Core data logic: _aggregate_data, _resolve_sort_order.

Styling / layout: _apply_common_style, _finalize_layout.

Chart primitives: _bar, _line, _pie.

Public API: bar(), line(), pie(), combo().

No decorators, no repeated kwargs threading — all public API methods do:

Merge kwargs + sticky → self.chart_params.

Call _foo.

Call _apply_common_style + _finalize_layout.

Return fig, ax
```

```consolidate layout logic
Instead of _finalize_layout + common_args + FONT_PRESETS sprinkled across decorators, you’d have something like _apply_common_style(ax) that applies all axis/label/font/grid defaults in one place.

_finalize_layout would then just worry about legends & titles
```

```making ChartMonkey stateful
At the start of a chart call, collect all params (kwargs + defaults + sticky) into self.chart_params.

All helpers (_aggregate_data, _finalize_layout) read from self.chart_params, not kwargs.

No need for common_args decorator at all.
```

Because of the size of this task, we will break this down. You'll first provide the "pre class" contents, which will be the new ChartConfig class with appropriate defaults and so on. You'll then ask me if you should proceed to the next step, which will be building the top section of the class - the __init__ and so on, and the first component with all the core data logic. You'll then ask me if you should proceed to the next step, which will be the layout aspects. You'll then ask me if you should proceed to the next step, which will be the chart primitives. Finally, you'll ask me if you should proceed to the next step, which will be the public facing api.

Along the way, you can try and introduce some consistency to my docstrings, with a preference for google style docstrings.

## Automate versioning

Get more familiar with setuptools etc:

```chatgpt
Mechanics

Update pyproject.toml and tag:

git commit -am "Bump version to 0.1.0"
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "0.1.0: post-refactor, tests passing"
git push && git push --tags


Expose __version__ (handy in logs/plots):

# src/lazychart/__init__.py
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError
try:
    __version__ = version("lazychart")
except PackageNotFoundError:
    __version__ = "0+unknown"


(Now from lazychart import __version__ works in users’ envs.)

If you want to automate (optional)

Use setuptools-scm to derive the version from Git tags so you never edit it by hand:

# pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61", "wheel", "setuptools-scm>=8"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools_scm]
version_scheme = "post-release"
local_scheme = "node-and-date"


Then just tag v0.1.0; your wheels/install will carry that version (and dev builds look like 0.2.0.dev3+g<sha>).

```


# Priorities

## Current fix requests

#### Think added but need to check with demo_usage

* return data so we can do fig, ax, grouped = cm.bar(...) and then do display(grouped) to see the figures for ease of reference / commentary
* x axis horizontal for small labels
* no legend if only one category
* provide dict to quickly remap labels e.g. 0/1 becomes "No"/"Yes"
* sort by value doesn't work when no y axis variable, should sort by count in this case

#### To be added

* figure out how to handle x targets with categorical x values

* add combo chart once tested, with mix on the right side

I want to add in a compare chart which can compare two charts side-by-side (and ideally allow three side-by-side if it's not overly complex). I note that the _ensure_fig_ax function has been set up to accept an existing axis for this purpose. Ideally I would like the 

* delay chart which takes two date cols and/or date col + date const and calculates the difference then plots bar chart / line chart distribution (based on kind='bar' etc) of counts/outcomes grouped by the delay

### Prompt playground

Help me decide what to work on next. My options are:

1. Implement a new comparison() chart type which places 2 charts next to each other (and possibly 3) with a shared legend. I've been trying to structure my code to make this easier (e.g. _ensure_fig_ax accepts an existing ax and adds the extra one on), but I fear it will be a lot harder than I expect and may involve some major refinements. I want to do this sooner rather than later as it feels like one of the last major hurdles before I can move on to easier things such as adding in new chart types. I have some old code that attempted to implement this, which we could build on, or we could start from scratch, perhaps with me giving a clean docstring to explain what the function is intended to do.

2. I've recently implemented a bunch of things and I should go through and test these. I have a demo_usage.ipynb where I've been doing this. It probably wouldn't take too long and wouldn't be too hard to do this, but it also probably won't add much to the library assuming it's all been implemented well.

3. I have a pretty ordinary README file at the moment. I could update this. One specific thing I want to do is to take the ChartMonkey methods and parameters in COMMON_DOCSTRING and create a nice markdown formatted version to include in the README. This won't change the functionality of my package but will make it more accessible. However, as I'm continuing to add and update things I'll need to rework this, so there's some duplication of effort and arguably less immediate value than actually creating functional code.

4. My core.py file is getting quite large. I like having it in one file as it's quite easy to e.g. upload to ChatGPT for advice or transfer to work to put it through its paces, but at some point I suspect I'll end up splitting this into individual modules. This feels like a pretty major exercise, which I want to do before v1.0.0 but probably want to defer until things are a bit more stable. It feels like we're getting close, but I fear the comparison() update above may result in some significant changes.

5. I had an idea that it might be good to have a chart wrapper that applies for essentially all of the chart types. At present there's a lot of duplication between them in the stages they go through. It would be good to centralise this logic somewhere so e.g. bar() -> run common code -> as part of this run chart-specific code using a kind='bar' sort of argument and perhaps this _bar or perhaps it's in addition to it / somewhere along the line we need to call the specific bar plot method -> any other general stuff like saving figures and so on. Again, this feels like it could be a somewhat major refactor but perhaps limited to the primitives/api area at the bottom.

6. At the moment I have spent most of my time implementing and testing bar(). Another fundamental chart type is line() and I could spend some time in my demo_usage.ipynb exploring this. I think at some point I'll want this and feel embarrassed if it's not implemented, and I suspect in testing it I may encounter things that need to be updated in the data manipulation areas which I'm keen to lock down once they're "tried and tested".

7. I have a few specific charts in mind. It feels like these have to wait for items above, but I'm quite keen to get them implemented as a way of testing the above, and because I think they'll be particularly useful. Similar to comparison() I have some old code that attempted to implement this, which we could build on, or we could start from scratch, perhaps with me giving a clean docstring to explain what the function is intended to do:

7a. A "delay" chart. This takes a date or column of dates and then differences with another column of dates to get delays. Then a line chart is used to plot the "distribution" of whatever we're looking at in time delay relative to the (fixed or per row) starting date.

7b. A "mix" comparison chart. This has some sort of ratio on the left side (e.g. mean levels by category) and has the frequency chart on the right side (i.e. remove the y column from the spec so you get row counts instead).

8. Looking through my code for "TODO" comments that I've left lying around, looking at the different standard plot "kind" options and adding more functionality based on what I find.

What order would you approach these options in and why?

```chatGPT
Recommended Order
comparison() – unlocks layouts, reveals structural needs.  -DONE
Test existing code – quick confidence boost.
line() – fills a gap, stress-tests utilities.
Wrapper refactor – cut duplication, streamline growth.  -DONE
Docs/README – polish after stabilization.
Module split – structure for v1.0.
Specialized charts (delay, mix, etc.) – build on strong foundations.
TODO sweeps / extras – ongoing polish.
```


### Example data rework

I am developing a charting package and within the main class I have a function which generates example data to be used in testing and demonstrating the package. It's currently a bit ordinary and I'd like your assistance with improving it. Here's the current version:

    def example_data(self, n: int = 2000, seed: int = 42) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Return a synthetic wellness dataset for demos/tests."""
        np.random.seed(seed)
        dates = pd.date_range(end=pd.Timestamp.today(), periods=n)
        user = np.random.choice([f'user{i}' for i in range(1, 51)], size=n)
        sleep_hours = np.clip(np.random.normal(7, 1, n), 4, 10)
        steps = np.clip(np.random.normal(6000, 1500, n), 200, 15000)
        alcohol = np.clip(np.random.poisson(1.2, n), 0, 8)
        work_stress = np.clip(np.random.normal(5, 2, n), 0, 10)
        nutrition = np.clip(np.random.normal(6.5, 1.5, n), 0, 10)
        score = (0.4*sleep_hours + 0.001*steps - 0.5*alcohol +
                 0.3*nutrition - 0.2*work_stress + np.random.normal(0, 1, n))
        emotion = pd.cut(score, bins=[-10, -0.5, 0.5, 10], labels=['Engaged', 'Energetic', 'Happy'])
        df = pd.DataFrame(dict(
            date=dates, user=user, sleep_hours=sleep_hours, steps=steps,
            alcohol=alcohol, work_stress=work_stress, nutrition=nutrition,
            score=score, predicted_emotion=emotion))
        df['month'] = df['date'].dt.to_period('M').astype(str)
        df['weekday'] = df['date'].dt.day_name()
        return df

I want to make as many of the following changes as possible:

1. Add a docstring which explains the "scenario" and also the relevance (i.e. provide a rich set of data that can be used for testing and demonstration purposes, including numeric data, categorical data with low and high cardinality, temporal data, correlated data etc). The scenario is something along the lines of lifestyle data being collected for a range of users of a new lifestyle monitoring gadget. We might want to list out the relevant factors and/or group them - mindset is constant and comes from a personality survey when they join - start and end date indicate their participation period, lifestyle factors include sleep hours, exercise steps, standard drinks of alcohol consumed, work stress on a 0-10 scale, nutrition quality on a 0-10 scale. Within the code itself, include inline comments where relevant to make it easier to see how the data is being generated.

2. Add a global_trend parameter (not shown in the final dataset) which is set up front and which will influences all users (e.g. N(0,1)). For example, when plotting alcohol usage over time, I might expect to see this increasing on average if global_trend is negative. In general we can assume that work_stress and alcohol are "negative" and steps, sleep_hours and nutrition are "positive".

3. Add a season parameter (not shown in the final dataset) which is based on the quarter of the year (1, 2, 3, 4)

3. Add age_band (shown in the final dataset), based on a uniform distribution between 20 and 80 and binned to 5 year groups.

4. Add mindset, which is randomly "growth" "neutral" or "fixed" (shown in the final dataset). While these labels are evident in the data, under the hood, these labels will drive a trend factor which will mean these three groups have a different trajectory over time.

5. Add "start_date" and "end_date" using some sort of generating process that results in some users only having data for part of the period. This could be perhaps a normal distribution with a mean which is today-n/2 and a stdev that means a lot of the users will have start_date < today-n and end_date > today, which will then be capped at start_date and end_date respectively. From memory with a normal distribution 2 standard deviations is around 96% so perhaps we aim for around 1.5 standard deviations of the distribution covering the start_date - n to start_date period.

6. Rethink each of the individual components and add some sensible correlations. In general there should be some reliance on the global trend parameter, some reliance on the individual mindset, and some randomness, for which the existing distributions might be useful. At the moment, score is a function of the individual components and score drives the overall emotion, but I'm thinking we might want to add some correlations along the way by generating these in sequence based on how out of the user's control they would be e.g. global_trend > mindset > work_stress > alcohol > sleep_hours > steps > nutrition > emotion. So for example, the mean of the alcohol distribution might depend on global_trend and mindset, nutrition could depend on alcohol, sleep_hours and steps etc.

7. At present the "emotion" category is a function of the hidden "engaged" "energetic" "happy" scales. I think we replace this with a simple "happy" "neutral" "sad" classification based on a hideen energy_score and/or a few simple rules. For example, perhaps any time work_stress is higher than a given threshold or sleep_hours is less than a given threshold then emotion is "sad". I want there to be a good mix of emotions coming out of the end of this process.
